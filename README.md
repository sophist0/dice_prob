# dice_seq_prob
Working out the probability of rolling different dice sequences.

A full write up is in dice_prob_notes/dice_prob.pdf

To generate the monte carlo simulation data create a data/ folder, then change the "seq_end" variable and run sim_seq_roll.py for each sequence:
* 1
* 1,2
* 1,2,3
* 1,2,3,4
* 1,2,3,4,5
* 1,2,3,4,5,6

The plots can the generated by running plot_results.py
